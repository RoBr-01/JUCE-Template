# ðŸš€ C++ Template Project for JUCE-based audio applications (and plugins).

## Requirements

- Cmake
- Ninja
- LLDB

This template loosely assumes you are using VSCode, but you can set up your own debugging if preferred.

## Set-up

Clone the project using:

```sh
git clone --recurse-submodules <repo link>
```

This -should- immediately set-up the submodules as well.

Next you need to build the AudioPluginHost, which is located in:

```sh
cwd/lib/JUCE/extras/AudioPluginHost/Builds
```

There you can pick the platform you are building for, and build the *debug* version of the host.

## Usage

This project uses **CMake** for building.
In the root of the project run the following commands in a terminal window.

### Configure (Set Up the Build)

```sh
cmake --preset <configure preset name>
```

The available configure presets are:

- debug
- Release

### Build (Compile the Project)

After configuring, build using the corresponding preset:

```sh
cmake --build --preset <build preset name>
```

The available build presets corresponding to your configure preset are:

- build-debug (if you used the debug preset)
- build-release (if you used the release preset)

The finalfiles will be in:

```
cwd/build/build_preset/artefacts/build_preset
```

There you will find the AU, Standalone and VST3 builds.
